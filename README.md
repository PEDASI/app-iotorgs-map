# PEDASI IoTUK Nations Mapping Example

## Introduction

This PEDASI example shows how a JavaScript application can make use of the following to build and draw
a map of the locations of Internet of Things organisations at a given location:</p>

* A PEDASI external data source: the IoT UK Nations Database, containing a queryable database of Internet of
Things businesses and organisations across the UK.
* A PEDASI internal data source: a geocode lookup service that returns latitude and longitude coordinates given
a UK postcode.
* Leaflet.js: a JavaScript visualisation library used to plot the IoT businesses for a location on a
zoomed map, using OpenStreetMap as the map plotting service.
* JQuery: a JavaScript library used to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, and handle
asynchronous Ajax calls to the PEDASI Applications API.
* Bootstrap 4: an open-source front-end framework for designing web applications.
